# weatherservice

This is a simple weather app that will collect your current location and display the weather for that location.

### Dependancies
[GIT](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
AND some sort of terminal (linux/osx) or command line (windows,yuck)

How to start?

Clone this GIT repository.

Then just run (you will require NodeJS to compile and run this application):
(commands should be run in command line or terminal, duh!)

```javascript
npm install
```

Wait for the installation to finish (takes some time).
Then simply run:

```javascript
npm run dev
```

It will automatically start a `watch` server at `http://localhost:8000` on your machine.
